# CS1.0-Chat_Bot
 
This is a chat bot writtin in Python 3.7.9 that simply ask you how your week went.

Upon running the program, the user is asked to talk about how their week went. The bot will analyze the response and look for any key words or phrases that indicate wether or not the user's week was good or not, and then provide an appropriate resopnse. If the bot fails to find any key words or phrases, it will default to a more neutral response.

The user will keep getting prompted to explain how their week went until they type 'stop' (This is explained in the introductory message).

This is currently the extent of my chat bot.
